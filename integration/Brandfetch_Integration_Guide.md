## 1️⃣ Overview

**Objectives**
- ✅ Verify domain ownership (`xsunec.com`)
- ✅ Publish publicly accessible brand assets via GitHub Pages
- ✅ Ensure Brandfetch detection + logo synchronization
- 🔹 (Optional) Register Brandfetch API for future automation

## 4️⃣ API Readiness (Optional)

Brandfetch provides two API endpoints for developers:

| API Type | Endpoint | Purpose | Status |
|-----------|-----------|----------|----------|
| Brand API | https://api.brandfetch.io/v2/brands/xsunec.com | Retrieve brand metadata (logos, colors, fonts, social links) | Reachable (Unauthorized) |
| Logo API | https://api.brandfetch.io/v2/logo?domain=xsunec.com | Direct logo fetch for integrations | Reachable (Unauthorized) |

### Next Step (if activated)

1. Request API key → [https://brandfetch.com/developers](https://brandfetch.com/developers)  
2. Test endpoint via:
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>" https://api.brandfetch.io/v2/brands/xsunec.com
   ```
3. Save JSON output → `/integration/_api/brandfetch_response_sample.json`
